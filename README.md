# appscript-mail-convert-to-pdf-file
I put a comment to the code.gs file to make sure you will understand the code itself...

You can paste the code in your script editor. Follow the instruction below to access the editor:

1. Make sure you logged in your gmail account. Open a sheet
2. In the sheet, Go to Tools > Script Editor
3. Paste the code in your editor within a function... example: function convert_Email(){ ...the code here... }
4. Make sure to input your spreadsheet id and sheet name in the code for the appending of email data captured.
5. After saving, try to debug the code by clicking the Run/Play button >. An authorization window will prompt, make sure you allow it.
6. Click the Run button again and see the result...

If you have any inquiries regarding the code, please contact me through den.balinhawang@gmail.com
